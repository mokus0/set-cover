set-cover
==========

This is a library containing a simple brute-force solver and a few simple heuristics for the "set covering" decision problem and the related "minimal set covering" optimization problem.

Usage
------

TODO - write something here!  Probably after simplifying the API, it's a bit cluttered right now.

Installation
-------------

Currently the only option is to install from github:

    git clone https://github.com/mokus0/set-cover.git
    (cd set-cover; cabal install)
